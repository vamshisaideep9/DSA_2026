PYTHON LISTS:

A list is a built-in datastructure that can hold an ordered collection of items. 
- can contain duplicate items.
- Mutable: items can be modified, replaced or removed.
- Ordered: maintains the order in which items are added.
- Index-based: Items are accessed using their position.
- Can store mixed datatypes (Integers, Strings, booleans, even other lists).

CREATING A LIST

1. Using square brackets
2. Using list() Constructor
3. Creating List with repeated elements


ACCESSING LIST ELEMENTS

ADDING ELEMENTS INTO LIST
1. append()
2. extend()
3. insert()
4. clear()

UPDATING ELEMENTS INTO LIST

REMOVING ELEMENTS FROM LIST
1. remove()
2. pop()
3. del statement 

ITERATING OVER LISTS 


LIST COMPREHENSION: List comprehension is a concise way to create lists using a single
line of code. It is useful for applying an operation or filter to items in an iterable. 
such as a list or range.


HOW PYTHON STORES LIST ELEMENTS ?
A list doesnt store actual values directly. Instead, it stores references(pointers) to objects in memory.
List just keeps their addresses.

Modifying a mutable element can change the original object, while immutable remain unaffected.



TUPLES:

Create a new tuples using literals. 
EX: tuples = ("localhost", 2, 5.6)

You dont need paranthesis. comma seperated sequence is enough.

Can also create tuples using tuple() Constructor


DIFFERENCES:

1. Lists and Tuples are ordered sequences.
2. Lists and Tuples can contain Arbitrary objects.
3. Dont need to be unique.
4. Lists and Tuples can be indexed and sliced.
5. Lists and Tuples can be nested.
6. Lists are mutable, Tuples are immutable.
